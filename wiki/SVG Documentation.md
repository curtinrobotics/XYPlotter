## What is SVG?

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) codes 2D images using Extensible Markup Language (XML).

## Why are we using SVG?

We want to use SVG because it enables us to code in scalable and resizable pictures (ie vector images).

### Elements of SVG we are implementing 
We will list the elements below in the form
* element: 
	* attribute1 (explanation1) 
	* attribute2 (explanation2)
	* etc
* text: 
	* x (x position measured pixels from left, positive x is directed right)
	* y (y position measured pixels from top, positive y is directed down)
	* fill (colour filling the object)
	* stroke (colour drawn around object)
	* stroke-linecap (how the ends of the lines end, eg: "butt", "round", "square")
	* stroke-width (thickness of line)
	* stroke-linejoin (how lines are joined, eg: mitre, bevel, round)


* path:
	* d ()
## Examples

SVG lines of code start with

The document starts with <svg ... here go the shapes and text (we call elements) until you reach the end-of-line character ">"
and then finally end with a closing </svg >

Examples of elements we're implementing

Examples we aren't implementing:

We aren't implementing images (element "img") because we haven't the capabilities or time in this project to convert the bytes in images and raster form to vector images.

We aren't implementing the attribute in-fill
